# little desktop pet
little desktop pet made with tkinter

# to customise
1. replace gif files with ur own gifs 
2. change number of frames in main.py (lines 9-12)
3. change file names in main.py (if applicable) (lines 9-12)

**NOTE: if you have any white pixels in gifs, then they will get replaced with transparent, to combat this, in lines 19-23 in main.py, change 'white' to 'black' or any other colour**

*also, pet may walk off screen depending on screen size, change if statements in lines 77-80*
